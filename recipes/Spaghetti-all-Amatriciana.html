		<h1>Spaghetti all Amartriciana</h1>
		<img src="../images/Spaghetti-all'Amatriciana.jpg">

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This classic Roman pasta dish is quick and easy to make with few ingredients. Traditionally, guanciale is used, but I prefer pancetta.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or more if needed</li>
			<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>7 ounces pancetta bacon, diced</li>
			<li>2 cups passata (crushed tomatoes)</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon water, or more as needed</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
			<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Directions</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until golden brown, almost 5 minutes. Add pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in passata, water, and sugar; cook until sauce has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>Drain spaghetti and toss with sauce, remaining olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
		</ol>
